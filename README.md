# Donezo Web Application

## Project Overview
The **Donezo Web Application** is a collaborative software project aimed at developing a dynamic and interactive task management tool. This was a final group project for my **software requirements engineering principles** class 

## Features & Requirements
- **Add Tasks** – Users can input new tasks along with relevant details.
- **Delete Tasks** – Allows users to remove unnecessary or completed tasks.
- **Save Tasks** – Ensures all task data is securely stored in the system.
- **Complete Tasks** – Users can mark tasks as finished for better organization.
- **Prioritize Tasks** – Enables task sorting based on importance (High, Medium, Low).
- **Set Due Dates** – Helps users manage deadlines and stay organized.

## Development & Implementation
The application is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with local storage capabilities to persist tasks. The project includes structured testing, covering scenarios like invalid due dates and task prioritization, to ensure robustness.

## How to Run the Application
1. **Set Up Workspace** – Use a code editor and a web browser.
2. **Create Project Files** – Ensure the project includes:
   - `index.html`
   - `style.css`
   - `script.js`
3. **Launch the Project** – Open `index.html` in a web browser.
4. **Test and Use** – Add, delete, prioritize, and manage tasks.
5. **Refresh** – Local storage ensures tasks persist.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how teamwork and structured software development can create a **functional and user-friendly** productivity tool. By integrating key task management features, the application helps users **organize, track, and complete tasks efficiently.**
